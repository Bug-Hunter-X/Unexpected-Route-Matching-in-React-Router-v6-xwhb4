# React Router v6 Unexpected Route Matching

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using React Router v6: unexpected route matching and rendering problems.  The issue might manifest as incorrect component rendering or no rendering at all, even with seemingly correct route configurations.  This example highlights the problem and provides a solution.

## Problem

The original `App.js` contains a seemingly correct `Routes` configuration. However, depending on the navigation, unexpected rendering issues may arise.  The root cause is often subtle errors in route definitions or interactions with other parts of the application.

## Solution

The `AppSolution.js` offers a corrected implementation with explanations for the fixes applied.  This demonstrates a possible solution to solve this type of unexpected routing behavior in React Router v6.
